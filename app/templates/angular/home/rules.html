        <h4>Safety Policies</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Children should not be dropped off at school before 12:50.  If children arrive before 12:50, parents
                must accompany them into the school and remain with them at their child's grade table.  Children are
                not to go to their classroom until the bell rings - they must sit at their class table.  Also, if there is no
                CCA adult in the classroom, they are to remain outside the classroom and report the matter to a CCA
                staff member.
            </li>
            <li>
                No running inside the school building, except in the gym.
            </li>
            <li>
                Student who is eight years old or younger must be accompanied by an adult when leaving the
                classroom going to the restroom.
            </li>
            <li>
                All children are expected to obey the school rules, listen to their teachers and CCA staff.  There will
                be consequences for not following the rules or misbehaving - ranging from a 'time out' in the office, in
                school suspension or expulsion.   A reminder that parents are legally responsible for any damage that
                is caused by their child.
            </li>
            <li>
                Parents/teachers must immediately report to CCA staff in the case of any accident or damage to
                school property and fill out a damage report.
            </li>

        <h4>Disciplinary Procedures</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1st time offense – CCA sends a notice, and collect repair costs (if any) from the parents.

            CCA Food Allergy Policy
        </h4>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>
        CCA recognizes that food allergies, in some instances, may be severe and even life threatening. 
        CCA has adopted this policy to create a framework for accommodating students with food allergies
        and to reduce the likelihood of severe allergic reactions of students with known food allergies
        while at school.
        </p>

        <h4>Parent/Student Responsibility</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
            Parents of students, or students age 18 or older, with allergies must notify CCA of such 
            allergies at the beginning of each school year.  Such notice may be provided on the CCA 
            registration form completed by the parents, or by other acceptable means such as written 
            notice to the school principal.
            </li>    
            <li>
            Parents of students with life threatening allergies must:         
                <ul>
                </li>    
                <li>
                Have the student  or themselves carried their own Epi-pen all the time while at school;
                </li>    
                <li>
                If necessary, cooperate with CCA to formulate a FOOD ALLERGY ACTION PLAN in accordance with CCA Guidelines and 
                described more fully below.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>    
            <li>
            Parents are responsible to educate their student about managing his/her allergy at school,  including, but not limited to, identifying “safe foods,” by  discussing the vigilance required to     self monitor food products  sold at events or special student sales, foods brought for snacks .
            </li>    
        </ol>

        <h4>CCA Responsibility</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
            CCA must cooperate in the development of a FOOD ALLERGY ACTION PLAN for students with life threatening allergies in accordance with Guideline for Food Allergy Policy, if requested by student and /or parent of  food allergies. The FOOD ALLERGY ACTION PLAN must address (1) what actions will be taken to avoid exposure at school, and (2) what actions will be taken in the event of exposure.  The Plan shall be developed through consultation between the school staff, the student’s parents, and the student’s physician or allergist.  Once created, this Plan should be reviewed and updated annually by the school staff, the student’s parents, and the student’s physician or allergist.
            </li>    
            <li>
            CCA will share the FOOD ALLERGY ACTION PLAN developed with appropriate school teachers and staff.
            </li>    
            <li>
            With the consent of the student’s parents, a FOOD ALLERGY ACTION PLAN may provide a mechanism for CCA to provide notice to the student’s classmates and/or a student’s classmates’ parents of a life threatening food allergy in the classroom. 
            </li>    
        </ol>
